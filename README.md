# Securing Azure SQL Database

In this project, we are going to focus on five objectives:

- create a basic application environment consisting of a virtual network, Linux VM, and SQL Database

- limit network access to your Azure SQL Database by utilizing server-level firewall IP rules and virtual network access

- create database users and roles to easily manage permissions in your database

- enable Auditing and Temporal Tables to monitor executed queries and changes to your data

- configure a backup policy for your Azure SQL Database

We will do the following tasks:

Task 1: Setting up your environment
Task 2: Limiting network access to your database
Task 3: Creating a dedicated database user for your application
Task 4: Azure SQL Database Auditing and Temporal Tables
Task 5: Defining a backup policy for you Azure SQL Database
